                            A Passionate facilitator who inspires, and motivates the children to choose to learn and ultimately fall in love with the process,
                             this makes me a favourite teacher to all the students whom I have tutored thus far. 
                             It all humbly started in a small room with a few students who desperately needed help with their 5th std science subject in school, 
                             and who were scared to fail among their friends. But when they cleared their papers, I was the happiest for them, because even I discovered a teacher in me when I was only 16.
                             Since then taught and facilitated hundreds of children by choosing my career as a teacher. I have seen children and teenagers transform when they find someone who understands exactly what they are facing and someone helps them understand and get them through it.
                             I can assure you with the knowledge and expertise I have in scientific knowledge, I am the right choice you could make for your children to choose to learn. I proudly present to you “SCIENTIA”, your one-stop solution for your children to bloom with knowledge.
                            <p></p>
